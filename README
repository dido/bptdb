BPTDB -- A Simple B+ Tree Flat File Database

The amount of metadata for my game project is growing rapidly, and I
wasted a lot of time looking for a small and simple library that would
suit my needs.  In particular, one requirement was that it be able to
operate with the rather constrained file I/O interface provided by
libgdx, and this proved hardest to satisfy, so I needed to write my
own.  It took longer than it should have, but I probably wasted as
much time looking for someone else's library as I had writing this
one.

BPTDB consists of a Java library for reading these databases and a
Ruby program (ruby/bptree.rb) for building a flat file database based
on a textual form.  It is at present not possible to write databases
in Java: the Ruby program is required for that.
